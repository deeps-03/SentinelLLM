- **Ensemble scoring**: Combined confidence metrics

## 🌐 Access Points After Deployment

| Service | URL | Purpose | Credentials |
|---------|-----|---------|-------------|
| **Grafana Dashboard** | http://localhost:3000 | Main monitoring interface | admin/admin |
| **VictoriaMetrics** | http://localhost:8428 | Metrics API & web UI | None |
| **Direct Dashboard** | http://localhost:3000/d/97421c11-7a01-414e-b607-3c701c9cc21f | SentinelLLM Dashboard | admin/admin |

## 📊 Live Data Examples

After deployment, your friend will see **real-time metrics** like:
```
✅ Incident logs processed: 17
✅ Warning logs processed: 69  
✅ Normal logs processed: 64
```

And **AI classifications** like:
```
[2024-12-28 03:32:15] → Classified as: incident
AI Suggestion: Check disk space on /var/log partition. Consider log rotation setup.

[2024-12-28 03:32:16] → Classified as: warning  
AI Suggestion: Monitor this pattern for potential escalation to incident level.

[2024-12-28 03:32:17] → Classified as: normal
AI Suggestion: System operating within normal parameters.
```

## 🔧 Complete Docker Services

Your friend gets **7 production-ready services**:
1. **log-producer**: Generates realistic log data for testing
2. **log-consumer**: AI classification engine (XGBoost + Qwen)
3. **anomaly-detector**: Multi-model anomaly detection
4. **victoria-metrics**: Metrics storage and API
5. **grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
6. **kafka + zookeeper**: Message streaming infrastructure
7. **notifier**: Alert processing and notifications

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

Your friend will run these **3 simple commands**:
```bash
# 1. Get the code
git clone <your-repo> && cd SentinelLLM/LLMlogs
